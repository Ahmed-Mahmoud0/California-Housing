# California Housing

## Task

 ## Dataset
 
A modified version of the California Housing dataset available from Luís Torgo's page (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). The dataset may also be downloaded from StatLib mirrors.

The dataset in this directory is almost identical to the original with only a few tweaks.
